Genre Multiplicity: Prof. Keller explained how the labor model in Hollywood has changed over time, specifically with respect to the 1947 court decision that broke up the vertical integration of studios. Is it true that movies made today tend to have overlapping genres in a way that they did not in the past? Is is true that older movies tended to fit squarely in one genre, while more recent movies tend to span multiple genres? Is there a historical moment where this genre complexity begins? Does it have patterns of any discernible kind?

Rubric:
Baseline
+1 for having an .Rmd that compiles without errors
+1 for including a problem statement (what are you trying to figure out?)
+1 for using data from more than one table in your analysis
+1 for readable, well-documented code (i.e. appropriate comments, using line breaks, breaking code up into logical chunks, following a style guide)
+1 unnecessary messages from R are hidden from being displayed in the HTML
Average
+1 for joining multiple tables using SQL
+1 for using precise SQL queries (i.e. requesting only the columns you need, rather than requesting everything and filtering in R)
+1 for using efficient SQL queries (i.e. making use of an index column to speed things up, and including a comment indicating this)
+1 for using a data graphic to articulate your findings
+1 for including relevant external information to your analysis (e.g. important cultural context that the reader might not have, historical events that could be related to what you found, etc.)
Advanced
+1 for using a GitHub repository and including a link to it at the bottom of your submission
+1 for including a (well-supported!) alternate hypothesis / explanation for what you found
+0–2 WOW factor: awarded at the professors’ discretion for submissions that are exceptionally compelling
