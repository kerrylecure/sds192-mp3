Genre Multiplicity: Prof. Keller explained how the labor model in Hollywood has changed over time, specifically with respect to the 1947 court decision that broke up the vertical integration of studios. Is it true that movies made today tend to have overlapping genres in a way that they did not in the past? Is is true that older movies tended to fit squarely in one genre, while more recent movies tend to span multiple genres? Is there a historical moment where this genre complexity begins? Does it have patterns of any discernible kind?
