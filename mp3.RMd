Problem statement (need to be paraphrased): Hollywood seems to be more repetitive than it used to be. Is this true? We now have not only sequels, but also remakes and reboots. Are these follow-up films more common today than they used to be? Can you trace the evolution of sequels across time in Hollywood? Are sequels more frequent today? Is the spacing between a sequel and its original shorter than it used to be?
